                        This week, nothing much really happened apart from forming groups and the briefing 
                        of our assessments. I have joined groups with Edmond Hua and Patrick Hwang. Already 
                        working with them in previous semesters, I believe we can work well together as 
                        a group of 3.
                        <br><br>
                        Once our assessments were explained, as a way to tackle the design brief of how 
                        we can create an interface for autonomy, we used a method called Brain-Dumping. 
                        Brain-Dumping essentially is a method to fixate on the larger problem through minor 
                        ideas. Jotting down 2 relevant problems and 2 out of this world problems, they are 
                        then accordingly arranged and compiled between group members. The main reason for 
                        this brainstorming method is to analyse between the extreme contrast between two 
                        conflicting ideas, potentially bringing to light specific and universal problems.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is the result of our Brain-Dumping session. Looking at the bigger picture, it is 
                        clear that both sides contain problems more focused on cars and a few with other vehicles.

                        In our week 2 tutorial, we learned more about the design process where we looked deeper into 
                        each step. The steps for a standard design process is:

            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="four columns">
                    <ul class="contentlist">
                        <li>Define the Problem Space</li>
                        <li>Do Background Research</li>
                        <li>Specify the actual problem to solve</li>
                        <li>Brainstorm solutions</li>
                        <li>Choose the best solution</li>
                        <li>Do detailed design & development work to define the concept</li>
                        <li>Build a prototype</li>
                        <li>Test and redesign</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Obviously we would be focusing on defining the problem space as we are so early into 
                        the semester and our concept. 
                        <br><br>
                        The tutorial also showed us a new way of coming up and targeting on ideas which was 
                        the stakeholder map. A stakeholder map is used to visually consolidate and communicate 
                        the key components to a design project.

                    <p>
                        Ultimately through this map, we can clearly see that cars have a major influence in 
                        daily human interactions.
                        <br><br>
                        So with these key problem defining methods, we thoroughly discussed what autonomous 
                        interaction would be the driving force in our design process and final concept. 
                        <br><br>
                        In the end we chose to focus on car parking. Parking is virtually essential to all 
                        vehicle owners. Every journey involves parking at the destination and in-between. 
                        With car ownership per household rising exponentially per year, conflicts in parking 
                        are acknowledged. These conflicts are largely defined in terms of supply (too few 
                        spaces are available, somebody must build more) or in terms of management (available 
                        facilities are used efficiently and should be better managed).

                        Unfortunately I was absent this week due to falling ill, but from the notes taken 
                        by my team members, this week was focusing on the methods and evaluation of user 
                        research. According to Task 1 which we have been working towards, It is done 
                        individually such as individual research, evaluation of that data and my own 
                        take of what our next step will be toward the rest of our semester. As a group 
                        we assigned 1 research method to each group member where I focused on the User 
                        Interviews. 
                        <br><br>
                        But as a whole, we conducted User Interviews, Surveys and Contextual Research.

                        Interviews are used to build up a deep understanding of the individual’s life, 
                        decisions and challenges. Interviews are “structured conversations” where 
                        questions are planned beforehand. 10 informal interviews were conducted, where 
                        all of them were university undergraduates within in the age 18-21. All interviewees 
                        are general drivers that commute to and from employment, education and recreation.

                        An online survey was created where we aim to include the main themes discussed in 
                        the previous interviews, and general demographics of drivers. The survey was 
                        shared and sent out to large university groups with the assumption that the majority 
                        of members are able to drive.

                        This week I just focused on completing my research report. To my groups dismay, 
                        we found out that we have to individually conduct our own research rather than doing
                        1 each and compiling our data. We completely misinterpreted the design brief and task 
                        description. Being scared to death we might lose a chunk of marks in Task 1, we came 
                        clean and told Hamish and our tutor Sophie about this problem. Fortunately they gave 
                        us a break and brushed it off.
                        <br><br>
                        After we conducted and evaluated this research we began to work on our research 
                        report and presentation. The research report consists of researching existing 
                        products that utilise autonomy in car parking. Briefly summarised, there are two 
                        products that largely utilise autonomous parking is the Ford Collaborative Parking 
                        and the Automated Parking System (APS).

                        Ford’s Collaborative Parking technology compiles data from sensors belonging to 
                        vehicles in a certain carpark. This data combined with the parking lots monitoring 
                        system to determine a parking spot it vacant. Collaborative parking is possibly able 
                        to coincide with autonomous driving where cars can be able to use this data to accurately 
                        navigate through a parking lot safely when arriving to the vacant spot.

                        <b><u>Automated Parking System (APS)</u></b>

                    <p>
                        A multi-tiered car parking system that essentially parks cars in specialised crates, 
                        stacking them on top of each other on several levels. This method allows for 20 cars to 
                        be parked in the same footprint of 4 parking spots. The utilisation of computer systems, 
                        sensors and cameras, require little effort for the drivers as the APS moves through the 
                        garage, finding an empty spot rather than the driver finding it themselves, ultimately 
                        reducing time and fuel wastage. However, this is a costly method as mechanical components 
                        need to be produced and a specific area needs to be developed. Currently the largest APS 
                        in Europa is in Denmark, providing 1000 parking spots via 20 lifts.

                    <p>
                        Additionally with so much data at our disposal, I created 2 personas that embodied the 
                        issues that are present with car parking.
                        <br><br>
                        On Thursday I presented my research report. I’d say it was a pretty good presentation 
                        but there were also a few setbacks. I’m not too confident with presentations and stuttered 
                        a lot but I felt I communicated my research to the class and my tutor.

                        The lecture and tutorial this week was very educational as Stephanie covered a 
                        lot of UI aspects that I feel like would be beneficial to our assessments. 
                        She covered on all the ways to prototype such as paper and digitally. She also 
                        gave us tips on how to communicate our ideas the best way as we can. 
                        <br><br>
                        A quick recap of what we have so far. Parking cars is a universal dilemma, 
                        and from our research conducted, we saw that there were many pain points with
                        parking cars.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some of these included:</p>        
                    <ul class="contentlist">
                        <li>Ineptitude at Parking</li>
                        <li>Difficulty finding parking spots</li>
                        <li>Clogging and congestion</li>
                        <li>Layout, Signage & Visual Communication</li>
                        <li>Confusion over payment and time limits</li>                           
                    </ul> 
                    <p>We summarised all these pain points into 2 aspects:</p>
                    <ul class="contentlist">
                        <li>Issues within existing parking infrastructure</li>
                        <li>Humans aren'y very good parkers</li>
                    </ul>      
                    <p>
                        Now going forward, these were the 2 things we wanted to always keep in mind and
                        come back to, as we ideated and prototyped on how Automated Parking can solve this.
                        <br><br>
                        With these aspects in mind, we conducted another session of brain-dumping:                            
                    </p>  
                    <img class="content" src="images/content/process/w5/braindump.jpg">
                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        These methods were used to encourage creativity among the group members. It was also done also to minimise creativity block and implicit bias, as people often subconsciously self-critique ideas before expressing them, and there are many insights showing how it’s the stupid crazy ideas that can lead to great concepts.
                        <br><br>
                        This lead us into more discussion on what were our most favorite ideas on the wall that is able to be enhanced into a full fledged interface. After much deliberation, each group member picked one concept off the wall to conceptualise and turn into low-fidelity prototypes. I picked to improve on the idea of Phone Controlled Automated Parking. Pat chose to improve on an in-car interface that controlled its automated parking. And Edmond decided on fleshing out the HUD based AI driving teacher idea.

                        With this week tutorial, where it was mainly about creating and evaluating low-fidelity prototypes. We learnt some strong evaluation methods that would be very suitable with our prototypes which were think-aloud and first click testing. We also looked into more physical paper prototype interactions but we won’t be using it that much. We learnt of a prototyping app called Marvel where you can import JPEG screens or take photos of wireframes, where we can add points of interactions and link to different screen like invision or other prototyping tools.
                        <br><br>
                        After conducting user research we came back together and began to synthesize our insights and brainstorm solutions to the main problems we identified. We began to develop these insights and concepts with storyboards to visualise the best scenario for our respective ideas.

                    <p>
                        <b><u>Idea 1 - Phone Controlled Automated Parking App</u></b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Connecting this mobile app to an autonomous car, they are able to allocate navigation as well as initiating autonomous parking. The app virtually controls parking all within one app where it will pay for parking fines, pay overtime parking rates, select the users desired vacant parking spot and to also autonomously navigate their car to their destination. This phone app aims to eliminate the need for autonomous car owners to worry about the availability of parking in their area or the availability of parking at their destination.                            
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b><u>Idea 2 - In-Car Interface</u></b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This concept is an In-car User Interface used to self-park the car after the passenger alights. The interaction occurs through the car’s inbuilt information systems screen. Once the car is almost arrived at the drop-off destination, it will queue the user to select parking preferences depending on Price, Time and Geography. The left side of the interface provides options, whereas the right side provides live information such as current location and nearby parking options.                            
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b><u>Idea 3 - HUD AI Teaching</u></b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Based off the user research results from the first assessment, we discovered that there were many individuals that felt that the problem with parking and congestion was due to the overall lack of driving skill in drivers. HUD is an AI Teaching system that is integrated into the users car, it teaches the user where and how to drive, with AI driving assist features. It uses a Augmented Reality display integrated into the cars screen. The concept is a two step process consisting of the phone app and the AR screen. The user selects their parking destination and is provided with information about the parking availability, then uses Near Field Communication (NFI) in the car to send the destination to the car - making the process as seamless as possible.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        After finishing our storyboards, we started sketching up concepts through a series of annotated hand-drawn UI sketches depicting potential solutions for the visual interface. These sketches include the most important screens rather than the minute details such as login and settings screens.

                        The wireframes continued to grow in fidelity and we also did some basic walkthroughs with a few users to gauge basic usability. The wireframes were also presented to other groups were suggestions were made to change notifications and other UI elements. Especially with this weeks tutorial, we were introduced to a prototyping tool called Marvel/Pop. This deemed a valuable tool for us as 2 of our 3 ideas required a mobile interface. So with this in mind we decided to to finalise our ideas into mid-fidelity prototypes and get them ready for user evaluations. For my idea, the phone controlled automated parking, I printed an iPhone X template with a grid inside so it will be easier to precisely sketch in certain assets. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Below shows the general user flow diagram for the idea:

                    <p>
                        Through this user flow diagram, I then transferred the screens into the Marvel/Pop app so it will be easier to evaluate an interactive prototype with peers.

                        Heuristic Evaluation was conducted to identify any specific problems, and assess the usability of our interfaces by comparing it Nielsen’s 10 Principles for Interaction Design, also known as “heuristics”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We identified any problems encountered in Think-alouds or discovered by asking the user post-experience. For each of the problems, we identified which of Nielsen’s Heuristics it violated. Each group member would assess the severity from 1 - 5, with 1 having no issue, and 5 being catastrophic. All the scores were aggregated into an average. Users were also asked for any feedback or recommendations for each problem identified. We decided to use this user evaluation method as it is a useful method that requires low cost and can be conducted in a short time span. This method was also complementary to conducting think alouds, and identifying correct Heuristics is valuable for iterative and correct design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We we will also be using think-aloud user testing in conjunction with Heuristics evaluation as key problems from think-aloud will be further evaluated with Heuristics. We chose this Think-Aloud user testing Method as it helped us understand participants’ real-time thoughts and emotions as they occur, and as they attempt to work through issues they encounter. We decided to test with a single scenario for each concept, as the paper prototypes were still low-fidelity and had a linear user journey.

                        We also used First Click Testing which involves observing our users interactions to see the percentage of what users would interact with first and so on. First Click Test allows us to evaluate and understand the effectiveness and functionality of our wireframes, also giving us insights about how users differently approach their given tasks. This evaluation was done by timing and tracking each of the users clicks in relation to a set of given tasks. Users were then asked to rate the difficulty of each task from 1 - 5. 1 being easy and 5 being difficulty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So with the evaluation methods decided, we spent the rest of the week evaluating our ideas with these three methods. 
                        <br><br>
                        Now with all the data collected, we need to analyse the data in order to approach our finalised concept appropriately. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having the positive reception especially aimed towards the phone controlled automated parking app, we decided on this idea but also combine certain aspects from our other 2 concepts into one. Based on the sketches and lo-fi paper prototype of concept 2, we created a mid-fidelity interactive wireframe on Sketch and Invision, and conducted 5 additional user tests. Based on the data gathered from the user tests, we made an iterated UI.

                        This week we focused on updating the screens of the phone controlled automated parking and created our first round of wireframes for our final concept. We have to also focus on the presentation of our report.
                        <br><br>
                        Below is an example of the user flow diagram we created for the first wireframes.

                    <p>
                        This will not be sufficient as our final concept so we did another round of evaluation for these wireframes. The screens were prototyped using Marvel/Pop app as we do not want to waste time by moving it into InVision.

                    <p>
                        Through conducting Think-alouds and Heuristic evaluation, we were able to identify a few key issues that needed fixing. The think-alouds allowed us to empathize with the user’s emotions and frustrations during their experience. We ascertained the specific issues within the UI that caused these pain points. Heuristic Evaluation made us self-evaluate our designs and user feedback gave us valuable areas of improvement. Doing this also helped shift our designers’ mental model to make it more in line with the user.
                    </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        With valuable information extracted from the evaluation from the first iteration of our final concept, we went full force into designing our final concept with some extra changes in mind.
                        <br><br>
                        We created an updated user flow diagram which runs through the main screens smoothly.

                    <p>
                        Though the data gained from the Usability Evaluations, we were able to make a few, but incredible valuable adjustments to our wireframe.
                        <br>
                        Some of these included:
                        <ul class="contentlist">

                        We chose the user evaluation methods that we used because they:
                        <ul class="contentlist">
                            <li>Were rapid and low cost.</li>
                            <li>Helped us understand users’ mental models</li>
                            <li>Identified key issues in the UI.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These things were what allowed us to rapidly iterate multiple times upon our chosen initial concept.

                        As it gave us extremely valuable data, we will continue to utilise Think-aloud and Heuristic evaluation methods. However we will create more specific concrete tasks that will evaluate different aspects of the UI and user journey. We may also incorporate other rapid methods such as UMUX-lite for a more rounded evaluation. We want to stay lean, by conducting frequent, light user studies.
                        <br>
                        Going forward, we plan to iterate on our mid-fidelity wireframe using advanced prototyping tools such as Framer X and create a near-production hi-fidelity prototype that will encompass our entire user journey, such as payments, pickup and account settings.

                    This week is presentation week! We rehearsed our presentation and we did well if I say so myself. But I honestly did pretty bad as I was pointing out some aspects of our wireframes by pointing at the computer screen rather than the large tv that’s directed at everyone else. OH WELL. After the presentation we went to make our final concept wireframes interactive. We had a lot of options to choose from such as FramerX, InVision, Adobe XD and ProtoPie, but we ended choosing Atomic.io. Atomic.io is browser based prototyping tool which is relatively new to the market of prototyping tools coming out last week. We choose to use Atomic due to ts flexibility in animating aspects of designs through a timeline. Since no-one in our group in particularly is comfortable with coding in programs such as FramerX, Atomic was the perfect alternative for us.

                            We tested our final concept wireframes again to create even better wireframes to animate in Atomic. Though since most of us were busy leading up to task 3 & 4, we only did one evaluation method with a minimal amount of people. We chose think-aloud as they were one of the easier methods to do and we can extract loads of valuable data with a short amount of time. We decided to give our 3 participants a InVision prototype as we didn’t want to waste time animating on Atomic yet. Through the evaluations, we learnt that participants mostly wanted more aesthetic aspects in the design such as moving cars, fancy animations for transitions and also extra animations on things such as buttons or swiping motions. After finding what our users wanted, we updated our Figma wireframes into Sketch so it would be easier to import into Atomic as they provide a Sketch plug-in for that very purpose. This process was rather long as Figma doesn’t export into Atomic so we have to recreate everything into sketch. But this is a good time to make small changes and of course add the changes suggested by our participants in the evaluation sessions.

                        The start of week 12 was not eventful as we are just trying to grind Atomic and work as fast as possible for the deadline on Thursday night. But BAD NEWS, just as things were going pretty smoothly, around 75% into completing our interactive prototype, Atomic just so happens to fail on us. The editable page is unresponsive and sometimes would time out the whole browser such as making it laggy to even close the tab Atomic was on. Contacting the Atomic was useless as they instructed us to do some general troubleshooting that would not work at all. We pretty much tried atomic on every computer in room 313 and even on different OS. Nothing. Honestly with no other choice we had to contact Hamish and to our relief he gave us a 2 day extension for tasks 3 & 4. Of course this is no excuse to relax, we went straight into redoing our prototype again Atomic as there would be not enough time to learn another program. We had our fingers crossed throughout the whole process hoping that Atomic will not crash again. In some cases Atomic was buffering into our project and my heart dropped. Thank god the internet was just a bit slow and buffering took a bit more time.

                        Apart from that, we kept our noses down and worked on our prototype, create the walkthrough video which was relatively easy, then started coding the companion website for ParkOff! And to showcase this process journal.

                        The semester was terrific! Although i couldn’t be there for all the lectures (flu!), the ones where I was there was very important for the development of our concepts. The tutorials also tackled the practical side to the course where we did an immense amount of user evaluations to ultimately end up with our final design of ParkOff!. In my personal opinion, ParkOff!’s potential would have been even bigger if our target market wasn’t only focusing on driver’s relationship with autonomous cars. We could’ve focused more on autonomous cars and their interactions with different types of industries such as mail postage, garbage or helping stranded tourists finding their way back to hotels or landmarks. But we prevailed and made the best of such a generic topic with Pat’s, Edmond’s and myself‘s design thinking and create a great concept in ParkOff!.

                        I would like to thank Hamish, Sophie and of course all the guest lecturers and tutors helping and guiding us on tackling such a riveting design brief.
