                    With all our wireframes completed, we transferred them into the InVision prototyping tool for 
                    convenience when evaluating our concept, as they can display prototypes on mobile which correctly 
                    simulates the nature of our concept. With this iteration, we want to test the fluidity and aesthetic 
                    quality of the app. This will mean that we need to evaluate the user’s interactions with every 
                    aspect of each screen. We had a total of 3 participants for the evaluation phase where all 3 were 
                    classmates.  
                    <br>
                    Due to time constrictions, we used a very familiar evaluation method, we used think-aloud user 
                    testing as we believe we can get the most information about our prototype with this method in a 
                    short amount of time. Evidently, all 3 user testing sessions lasted between 5 and 10 minutes.
                    <br>
                    We chose this Think-Aloud user testing Method as it helped us understand participants’ 
                    real-time thoughts and emotions as they occur, and as they attempt to work through issues 
                    they encounter. We decided to conduct 3 tests to gather as much data as possible.

                        You have a dentist appointment and your car had recently dropped you off at the clinic. 
                        You will need to find parking for your car as would need at least 3 hours since after the
                        appointment you have to run a few errands.
                        <br><br>

                    Participants suggested that the car in the “currently parking” screen should be animated as if 
                    the car is automatically driving towards the parking spot, this would be a nice novelty way to 
                    visually indicate that the car is parking until the time limit card pops up. Participants also 
                    commented on the on the nature of going back to to view previous options.

                    Your appointment went a bit too long and you will need more than 2 hours for your errands 
                    meaning that you will go over your parking spot.

                        Participants suggested the way to look through cars and cards by swiping left/right on the 
                        pictures. The settings should be able to be on every screen and have the settings icon be easily 
                        accessible.

                        Although the evaluation was conducted under undesirable time conditions, we were still able to 
                        innovate new aspects into our eventual final concept and prototype. Participants were extremely 
                        fond with the aesthetical properties of the InVision prototype as their feedback were, for the 
                        majority focused on improving and adding new transitional cues and animating functions within the app.
